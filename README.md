DeepJetCore: Package for training and evaluation of deep neural networks for HEP
===============================================================================

This package provides the basic functions for out-of-memory training, resampling, and basic evaluation. 
The actual training data structures and DNN models must be defined in an additional user package. The data structures (defining the structure of the training data as numpy arrays), must inherit from the TrainData class, and must be reachable in the PYTHONPATH as "from datastructure import * " .
A script to set it up will be provided eventually. For reference, please see: 
https://github.com/DL4Jets/DeepJet/tree/master/modules


Setup python packages (CERN)
==========
It is essential to perform all these steps on lxplus7. Simple ssh to 'lxplus7' instead of 'lxplus'

Pre-Installtion: Anaconda setup (only once)
Download miniconda3 (you can also get 2, but support ends at the end of this year)
```
cd <afs work directory: you need some disk space for this!>
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Please follow the installation process. If you don't know what an option does, please answer 'yes'.
After installation, you have to log out and log in again for changes to take effect.
If you don't use bash, you might have to add the conda path to your .rc file
```
export PATH="<your miniconda directory>/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
```
This has to be only done once.


Installation:

```
mkdir <your working dir>
cd <your working dir>
git clone https://github.com/andrzejnovak/DeepJetCore
cd DeepJetCore/environment
./setupEnv.sh deepjetLinux3.conda
```
For enabling gpu support add 'gpu' as an additional option to the last command.
This will take a while. Please log out and in again once the installation is finised.

Before new changes are added to the installer to make this work on Maxwell:
```
source gpu_env.sh
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install keras --upgrade
pip install pandas
```

Compiling DeepJetCore
===========

When the installation was successful, the DeepJetCore tools need to be compiled.
```
cd <your working dir>
cd DeepJetCore
source lxplus_env.sh / gpu_env.sh
cd compiled
make -j4
```

After successfully compiling the tools, log out and in again.
The environment is set up.
